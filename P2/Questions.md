## Questions to ask

### What exactly are we supposed to do as a "client"?

- How does the client interact with the server
- What kind of connection is supposed to be set up

### Why don't POST operations work while any other op works, like GET, UPDATE and DELETE

- What the guy above said

### Should the client tasks be done with @Query or should we implement some other way to do it?
